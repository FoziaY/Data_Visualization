## 10. Conclusions
The comprehensive data analysis revealed significant insights into the effectiveness of Capomulin in SCC treatment. The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, potential outliers, and gender distribution among mice added depth to our understanding of the study results.

In conclusion, the key findings are as follows:

- **Effectiveness of Capomulin:** Capomulin demonstrated notable efficacy in reducing tumor volume compared to other treatment regimens.

- **Correlation with Mouse Weight:** A positive correlation was observed between mouse weight and average tumor volume, suggesting that mice with higher weights tended to have larger tumor volumes.

- **Outlier Identification:** The box plots helped identify potential outliers in the final tumor volume, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of treatment outcomes.

- **Gender Distribution:** The study population showed a relatively balanced distribution of gender among mice, ensuring a diverse representation in the analysis.

These findings provide valuable insights for Pymaceuticals Inc. in shaping future research directions and refining treatment strategies for SCC. The combination of statistical analyses, visualizations, and summary statistics forms a robust foundation for evidence-based decision-making in the field of cancer research.
